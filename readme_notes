1) I created and pushed docker image of django framework that says hello world and is pushed to your docker hub repo with name 
docker pull praveenreddy544/docker_django:django_helloworld_app


2) Below are your docker hub creds

go to dockerhub and login using as

praveenreddy544

3) How to use this docker image to spinup services are below steps are:

a) Install docker-ce on your centos and start docker service. AFter docker is isntalled, run docker images and after verification, and run below commands
b) docker pull praveenreddy544/docker_django:django_helloworld_app
c) verify docker image is pulled using command docker images
d) start container using command docker run -p 8009:8009 -it 439803065902 python /code/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8009
e) now you can see port 8009 is publisehd to your local server and you can start using
f) you can spin up docker service with  docker-compose using below config as

[prav@slave1 pythondjango]$ cat docker-compose.yml
version: '3.7'

services:
  web:
    image: praveenreddy544/docker_django:django_helloworld_app
    command: python /code/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8009
#    volumes: # used duirng initial image creation
#      - .:/code # mount your local workspace into containers workspace
    ports:
      - 8009:8009

g) run docker-compose up and this will directly spin up docker service and  you can start using that
